Below is an example script in Python that leverages `imaplib` to connect to both source and destination IMAP servers and migrate emails and folders from the source account to the destination account. This script will:

1. Connect to the source and destination IMAP servers.
2. Iterate through folders in the source account.
3. Copy emails from the source account to the destination account for each folder.

This script assumes you have the necessary permissions and credentials for both email accounts.


### How to run the script:
1. Replace the placeholders for `source_server`, `source_port`, `source_username`, `source_password`, `destination_server`, `destination_port`, `destination_username`, and `destination_password` with the actual values.
2. Ensure the IMAP servers are correctly set up for the respective email accounts.
3. Make sure to install any necessary Python packages using `pip install imaplib`.
4. Run the script using `python migrate_emails.py`.

### Notes:
1. **Error Handling:** The script includes basic error handling for connection failures and message fetching issues.
2. **Folder Creation:** The script assumes that it needs to create folders on the destination server if they donâ€™t exist.
3. **Testing:** Test this script with a small set of emails first to ensure it works correctly before running a complete account migration.
4. **Security:** Handle and store your credentials securely to avoid exposing them in the script or command line.

This script should give you a basic but complete way to start migrating emails between IMAP accounts. Adjust folder handling, logging, and error handling as needed for your specific use case.
